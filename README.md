## Usage
Dead simple, just visit the url above or for local use, clone this repo and run the index.html page in a browser (assuming a server is configured).

If you're unable to run a server on your computer for whatever reason but need a genuine non psuedo random number on-the-fly, you could simply use the number 4. It's guaranteed.

## Why the name?
For sake of brevity, we're going with the name NoJS Random. It's just much easier to find something named NoJS Random as opposed to NoJS Non-psuedo Random or even NoJS Non-Random. And really, this is just some random project you happened to stumble upon. The name is accurate in that sense.
